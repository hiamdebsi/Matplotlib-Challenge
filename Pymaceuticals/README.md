Here are three observable trends based on the data:

1. Given the Summary Statistics generated, it can be concluded that the when a mouse undergoes the Capomulin Regimen, the tumor volume averages to be the one of the smallest, along with the Ramicane Regimen.
2. This efficiency of these regimens is further emphasized in the Line Graph for the mouse ID m601. It is evidently seen that as time passes under the Capomulin Regimen, the mouseâ€™s tumor volume decreases significantly.
3. The regression analysis allowed us to analyze the dependency of the tumor volume on the weight of the mouse. Given an r-value of 0.71, it is deemed that the relationship between the variables is moderately strong and the model can be used for extrapolated results. Overall, we see that as the average weight increases, the average tumor volume increases as well.
