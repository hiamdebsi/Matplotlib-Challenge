Here are three observable trends based on the data:

1. Given the Summary Statistics generated, it can be concluded that under the Capomulin Regimen, the tumor volume average is one of the smallest, along with the Ramicane Regimen.
2. The efficiency of the Capomulin drug is further emphasized in the Line Graph for the mouse ID m601. It is evidently seen that as time passes under the Capomulin Regimen, the mouseâ€™s tumor volume decreases significantly.
3. The regression analysis allowed us to analyze the dependency of the tumor volume on the weight of the mouse.It is seen that as the average weight increases, the average tumor volume increases as well. And given an r-value of 0.71, it is deemed that the relationship between the variables is moderately strong and the model can be used for extrapolated results.
